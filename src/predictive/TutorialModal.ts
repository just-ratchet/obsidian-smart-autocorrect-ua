/**
 * "Getting started": a five-step tour shown once, after the first-run model download.
 *
 * Deliberately short. The plugin has a lot of surface, but only a few things a new user MUST
 * know or they will not understand what is happening to their text: Tab accepts, space
 * corrects, and undo puts a wrong correction back. Every other feature is discoverable from the
 * settings tab and does not need explaining up front. A longer tour is a tour people click
 * through without reading, which helps no one.
 *
 * It ends on the stats counter rather than another feature: finishing on what the plugin has
 * done FOR you is a better last impression than one more thing to learn, and it points at the
 * status bar, which is the one piece of the UI that is always visible.
 *
 * Each step is one line of text and one picture, because that is what gets read.
