/**
 * "Link selection" (#7): replaces the plain add-link flow for a highlighted selection with OUR
 * recommendations, in the SAME right-docked chooser the link icon uses - list above, section
 * preview below, arrow keys to browse. Reuses the RelatedIndex scoring the ambient icons and
 * the `[[` picker use, so the ranking is consistent everywhere.
 *
 * It is deliberately not a modal. The point of this flow is that the selection stays selected
 * and visible while you pick what to link it to; a modal would dim the note and take the
 * selection away. Choosing replaces the selection with `[[Note#Heading|selection]]`, so the
 * text you highlighted is what you end up reading.
