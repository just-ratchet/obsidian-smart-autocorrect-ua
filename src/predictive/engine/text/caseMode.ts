/**
 * How suggestions should be CASED before the user ever sees them.
 *
 * Case is a property of the POSITION (and of what the user is physically doing) -
 * never of whichever channel produced the candidate. Deciding it here fixes two real
 * bugs: suggestions used to be shown in whatever case the model returned and only got
 * capitalised by autocorrect AFTER the word was committed (so an empty document
 * offered "the", you accepted "the", and it silently became "The"), and a sentence
 * start could offer "The", "there", "Their" at once because the LSTM, n-gram and
 * fuzzy channels disagreed. One decision, applied to the whole list.

/**
 * Is the user writing in CAPS at this point in the text?
 *
 * A pure function of the text before the cursor - deliberately NOT a stateful "mode"
 * and not a Shift listener. That is what makes it rigorous: deleting a character
 * simply re-evaluates the shorter text, so "THe" (off) going back to "TH" turns caps
 * on again with no bookkeeping to get stale, and a mode can never survive an edit that
 * removed the evidence for it. It also sees CAPS LOCK, which no Shift listener can.
 *
 * Caps mode is on only when the user is ACTIVELY writing caps, evidenced by EITHER:
 *   - 2+ capitals in the word adjacent to the cursor (they are shouting right now), OR
 *   - a RUN of 2+ consecutive all-caps words (sustained caps carried across a boundary,
 *     so after "THE QUICK " the next suggestion is already caps with nothing typed yet).
 * A single all-caps token in otherwise-lowercase text is an ACRONYM ("...is NASA "), not
 * shouting, and must NOT flip the following suggestions to caps - that is what produced
 * an uppercased next-word suggestion after a plain acronym. An acronym that sits INSIDE a
 * caps run still counts (it is part of the run), so the run continues until the first
 * actual lowercase letter, which always turns caps off immediately.
