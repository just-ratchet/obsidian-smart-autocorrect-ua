/**
 * Deterministic casing/contraction fixes that complement the statistical
 * autocorrect (they don't replace it):
 *
 *  - fixDoubleCapital: "THe" -> "The" / "ПРивіт" -> "Привіт" (shift held a beat too long),
 *    leaving acronyms (NASA, ЗСУ) and CamelCase (TypeScript) alone.
 *  - fixContraction:   "dont" -> "don't" - ENGLISH-ONLY (Ukrainian has no contractions to
 *    restore; its apostrophe is handled by the typo model). A curated failsafe for the common
 *    apostrophe cases, so they're guaranteed corrected AND never learned into
 *    the personal recommendation data. Only unambiguous non-words are listed.
 *
 * Proper-noun casing USED to live here as a static CaseMap. It was removed: the
 * LSTM's case head decides capitalisation in context (see engine/lstm/model.ts
 * renderCased), which a frequency map cannot do - it would capitalise "polish" in
 * "i will polish it" just because "Polish" is common.
