/**
 * The bridge between the LSTM's token stream and the n-gram/vault side.
 *
 * This file used to hold CasedLstmModel, which marginalised each lowercase
 * candidate over its cased variants ("paris" = paris + Paris). That job is GONE:
 * the LSTM vocab is now lowercase and capitalisation comes out of a separate case
 * head (see model.ts renderCased), so there are no variants to sum over and the
 * LSTM is already a lowercase model. It reads the context directly, lowercasing
 * internally, and keeps the punctuation - the continuous stream it was trained on,
 * spanning sentences, so it can SEE where a sentence ends rather than guess.
 *
 * What still needs adapting is the other direction: the n-gram was built from
 * per-sentence, punctuation-free, lowercase word context, and the LSTM's wider view
 * must not leak into it.
