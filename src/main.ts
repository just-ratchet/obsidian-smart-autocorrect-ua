 * Smart Autocorrect - entry point.

 * language model (see ./predictive). The plugin is intentionally tiny: it loads
 * settings, wires the predictive feature, and exposes its settings tab. All behaviour
 * lives in ./predictive (Obsidian glue) and its vendored ./predictive/engine
 * (unit-tested core). Fully offline - nothing leaves the vault.
